                                      <br>
                                      How many times have you thought that you wish to give something back to society and country? How many times have you thought that I will surely start when the right time comes? Well, as they say, the best time to start was yesterday and the next best time is now! NSS IIT Bombay gives you an opportunity of contributing to Community service while the time you invest also contributes towards fulfilling your academic requirements.

                                      <br><br>
                                      <b>What is NSS?</b>
                                      <br>
                                      As part of NOCS01 and NOCS02 (Compulsory courses for passing out of IIT Bombay), you can opt for NSS, NSO or NCC. Thus NSS (National Service Scheme) becomes part of your curriculum during your first year where you invest your time for the betterment of society around you. NSS IIT Bombay is the largest volunteer group inside campus working in the field of Community service and has been working in various fields. Education of underprivileged kids, improving their lifestyle, maintaining the biodiversity, using engineering knowledge to improve the innovations by uneducated, sustainable development are a few of the areas.
                                      <br><br>
                                      NSS organises sessions on daily basis. First year students have the responsibilities like teaching school subjects and other extra curricular activities to the children, planting tree saplings for specific purposes and maintaining them, innovating different activities like how can we reuse the trash, making something useful from trash, surveying and suggesting improvements in innovations by grassroot innovators, meeting underprivileged people like construction workers, understanding their problems and working towards solving them, creating content for NSS YouTube channels (Open Learning Initiative -an initiative to make educational content available in regional language and Voice for Purpose - an initiative for making audiobooks available for visually challenged). These are just a few activities among the many activities you can participate.
                                      <br><br>
                                      First year students, when selected in NSS, are allotted a department inside NSS according to their preferences and the team guides them regarding all the activities. If you have never experienced the joy of giving and want to explore the ecstasy of doing something selflessly, this is the right place to invest your time in!
                                      <br><br>

                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">SARC</p>
                                      What distinguishes this college from many others & makes it renowned all over the world? It is our alumni who have achieved great heights in myriad fields and made a mark for themselves in this super-competitive world. But how do we effectively utilize this wealth of knowledge, success and fame that our alumni have achieved? That is where SARC comes in.
                                      <br><br>
                                      Student Alumni Relations Cell (SARC) is an organization run by the students of IIT Bombay. Unlike other student bodies, it is an Institute Body (which means that it is officially supported and formed by the college) which works with the Dean ACR Office & IITB Alumni Association. It is dedicated to strengthening the bond between students and alumni. SARC has been able to gather donations from our alumni for the last many years, which include scholarships, funds for construction and research, allowances for workers, and many other programmes!
                                      <br><br>
                                      SARC conducts several initiatives in its flagship event, Alumination, like Mock Interviews, Group Discussions, Speed Mentoring, Workshops, etc. which help students to interact with alumni in person & get both career & general life guidance. SARC has also launched Alumni Student Mentorship Program (ASMP), whose aim is to allot alumni mentors to students to help them make crucial life-changing decisions. Phonathon allows students to have one-on-one telephonic conversations with alumni. We conduct Reunions as well, where alumni revisit old memories and cherish their everlasting bonds.  Anyone involved with SARC gets the golden chance of duologues with eminent and distinguished alumni like Nandan Nilekani, Jairam Ramesh, Pranav Mistry, Bhavish Aggarwal and several others. By executing alumni-driven initiatives for the benefit of students and enabling a mutually fruitful relationship between students and alumni, SARC volunteers get an insider’s view into the alumni’s world. Everyone is encouraged to be a member of the SARC family and get the invaluable experience of fraternizing with alumni and learning from them!

                                      With the onset of puberty, one grows more conscious of the changes happening in their own body as well as their feelings towards others. Unlike others, some of us may not feel comfortable with the gender assigned to us at birth. Similarly, not everyone is attracted only to people of the opposite sex. Some labels commonly used by people to describe themselves are lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, transgender, intersex, and queer. Collectively, people who lie outside the typical gender identity and sexuality are known as the LGBTQ+ community. Being a minority, they feel alone, confused and excluded from the mainstream. They may also face discrimination and bullying on revealing their preferences. At IIT Bombay, however, no student needs to feel alone.

                                      <br><br>
                                      Saathi (‘companion’) at IIT Bombay is an LGBTQ+ support and resource group. We are committed to providing a community for LGBTQ+ individuals on campus. We organize events all through the year such as workshops, awareness days, movie screenings and informal meetups. Most of these events are open to all, irrespective of gender identity or sexual orientation. Even if you identify as straight (as many of our members do), these events will be a great place to know more about the community and learn how to be great allies and support your LGBTQ+ friends.
                                      <br><br>
                                      All our events are safe spaces wherein we even do not ask anyone their sexuality or gender identity. However, we understand that you may be apprehensive of your identity being disclosed outside the group. You can still get in touch with us via e-mail or Facebook. To remain up-to-date with our events and other information, join our Google group, look up ‘Saathi, IIT Bombay’ on Google Groups or send an email at <a href="mailto:saathi-iitb+subscribe@googlegroups.com" class="link">saathi-iitb+subscribe@googlegroups.com</a>.

                                      We invite you to be a part of Saathi, irrespective of your gender or orientation. We hope that your stay at IIT Bombay will be as bright and vibrant as the colours of the rainbow!

Our initiatives enable the volunteers to interact with various sections of the society and feel their problems, only to come back with a fire to change the way it is. Our two day Social-Festival, the largest organized by any student body in the country, focuses on fostering leadership and social impact. We organize a plethora of activities to bring the entire 360 degree view of the problem on the table. We, then move on to building solutions by connecting to various NGOs and enterprises. Apart from this, Abhyuday also works on building collaborations with like-minded organizations such as Satyamev Jayate & The Gates Foundation.
