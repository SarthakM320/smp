                      The undergraduate curriculum at IIT Bombay is modelled after the curricula of the best universities in the world,
                      and is truly one of the most exciting and versatile in India. It blends flexibility with academic rigor, allowing
                      students to take up some courses of their own choice, both within and outside their departments, apart from completing
                      a certain minimum requirement of “core” courses.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      Here at IITB, the academic year is divided into two semesters, each lasting about 16 weeks. Each semester, you have
                      to complete a certain number of credits/courses. Based on your performance, you are assigned a grade at the end of
                      each course. The weighted average of your grade points for all the courses in a particular semester gives your Semester
                      Performance Index (SPI). The weighted average of these SPIs gives your Cumulative Performance Index (CPI). CPI gives an
                      overall impression of your academic performance and plays an important role in course/project allotment in later semesters,
                      not to mention internships and placements.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      A word of caution: According to a recent ruling, a professor is allowed to set any minimum attendance requirement (usually
                      80%) for his course. If a student does not meet this specific requirement, the professor is fully within his/her rights to
                      award them an ‘DX’ grade, in which case they will have to repeat the course. So do make it a point to be regular in all courses.
                      In case a student is unable to achieve the minimum cut-off marks in a particular course they fail and receive an FR grade.
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      Exceptional performance in a course can even earn you the highly valued AP grade in that course. Awarded rarely to more
                      than 1% of the class strength, it is a feather in a cap worth striving for.

                      The most exciting part of the system, for the academically-inclined, is the concept of Minors & Honours. Starting from
                      third semester, you will be allowed to take up courses in any discipline that you might happen to be interested in
                      (say, Electrical Engineering or Biology). You can earn a Minor in specific discipline by doing a certain number of extra
                      courses in that discipline. Be warned that registration for Minor courses, particularly in ‘popular’ departments, is very
                      competitive, with a seat-cap on all courses. If you are serious about your Minor ambitions, then be on your toes and maintain
                      a good CPI right through your degree programme!
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      Dual Degree students, in addition, must have a CPI of more than 8.0 and zero backlogs in order to be allowed to register
                      for Minor courses, as they already have an extra ‘DD elective’ course to complete in addition to the core courses,
                      from second year onwards. The B.Tech students too have the option of completing a certain number of these elective courses
                      in their own department and earn a ‘B.Tech. with Honours’ degree. Honour courses are highly recommended, they’re usually a
                      lot more interesting and fun than the regular ones!
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      Finally, if you happen to have any backlog(s), you will have to repeat (and this time around, hopefully pass) the course(s).
                      Typically, one-tenth of the class fails every course.

                          This site is meant for you, the future entrants into the IITs, to get an idea of what the different branches actually do and what engineering/sciences really involve. We, the students of IIT Bombay, have prepared this material describing the programmes offered at IIT Bombay based on our experience here. The description of each programme is focused on how it is structured at IIT Bombay and the nature of similar programmes offered at other colleges might be different. To get an in-depth description of all the departments and programmes, do check out the individual websites of each IIT.

                    IIT Bombay has been a leader in technical education in the country and has been recognised internationally for the
                    calibre of its students. IIT Bombay aims to produce leaders and innovators that can positively impact the society.
                    Academic Integrity is one of the core values propagated by this institute to achieve this aim.. All the students are
                    expected to adhere to an Academic Honour Code and maintain a high standard of conduct.

                    Cases of academic dishonesty are dealt with seriousness. Disciplinary Action will be taken against students who are
                    found to violate the code by the Academic Disciplinary Action Committee (ADAC) depending on the severity of the act of the
                     malpractice. Here are some acts of malpractice and the indicative punishments that may be imposed

                      Faculty Advisors (FacAd), as the name suggests, are professors from your respective departments, who will help you out
                      in making academic decisions. FacAds keep track of your progress and will guide you properly. Each semester, the courses
                       you take will be finalized only with the consent of the FacAds. Changes in the program, such as dropping of courses,
                       withdrawal from a semester on medical advice etc., can be effected only with the consent of the FacAd. The FacAd might
                       play a limited role in the first year. But as you grow older in the IIT system, you might have to make some tough
                       decisions regarding coursework and programmes in order to choose a career path suitable to your interests. If you intend
                       to change your branch/specialization after the 1st year, your FacAd is the right person to approach. You may also have to
                        seek the FacAd's permission to participate in inter-collegiate competitions. The FacAd is an important link between you
                        and your department. Do not hesitate to talk to them regarding any academic issue.

                      Departmental Academic Mentorship Program is an attempt by SMP to provide a helping hand
                      available to students who aren't freshmen any more, with their academics.The program consists of highly motivated senior students from each department to act as mentors for a set of junior students and help them cope with any academic problems they may face in the department or otherwise.
                      <br><br>
                      Freshman year has common courses for all departments, except a Department Introductory Course. As in the future years, there are more of department specific courses and electives, and students may need assistance maneuvering their way through these. With this in mind, all sophomore are provided with a DAMP mentor. Mentors are also provided for any students with backlogs after sophomore year. The mentoring relationship provides an opportunity for development, both for the mentors and the students (mentee), thus being mutually beneficial. 
                      <br><br>
                      SMP is a close knit team with the SMPCs at the top with a cabinet of six people to work with the different verticals under the SMP. Two Cabinet Head members lead a group of DAMP Coordinators (DAMPCs). Each department has one or two DAMPCs. The DAMPCs head a group of mentors who then come in contact with the students who need them (mentees). It is a purely voluntary program meant to pass on the experience, advice and techniques of managing academics through the generations.
                      <br><br>
                      DAMP attempts to make the academic life of all students in the institute easier, and makes sure
                      those who require support never lack in it whatever year of your programme you might be in.

                  <p>
                    At IITB, you have various platforms and opportunities to learn and develop a wide range of
                    essential skills to prep you for the world outside. English is the language of communication in
                    our institute and to make the best use of your stay here, you need to be proficient in it.
                    <br>
                    We strongly feel that a mere language gap should not stand in the way of excellence. ELP
                    provides for a structured program for all undergraduates who wish to improve their proficiency in
                    english.
                    <br>
                    ELP is divided into 2 independent programs:
                  </p>
                  <br><br><h4>THE BRITISH COUNCIL PROGRAM</h4>
                  <p>
                    This program is specifically designed for ​ freshmen only ​ wherein professional instructors from
                    British Council have 2 sessions every week throughout the year. These sessions involve a
                    plethora of interactive activities which develop primary skills associated with an overall
                    command of the language- like speaking, writing and reading.
                  </p>
                  <br><br><h4>ENGLISH LANGUAGE IMPROVEMENT TRAINING [ELIT] PROGRAM</h4>
                  <p>
                    English is the language of communication in our institute. A survey conducted in the institute indicates that most of the students feel uncomfortable with speaking in English
                    and a majority feel that academic problems are directly correlated with the ability to
                    comprehend English. ELIT is an initiative to bridge this language gap.
                    How does ELIT help?
                    <ul>
                      <li>Teaching basic English with the help of interactive activities and other learning</li>
                      <li>Providing supplementary resources available online to students, thus helping them to learn at their own pace.</li>
                      <li>Creating an informal environment where students can learn English with the help
                      of TAs.</li>
                      <li> To help students develop condence in English speaking which would help them improve their internship and placement prospects.</li>  
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <br><br><h4>BREAK THE STIGMA</h4>
                  <p>
                    While everyone is aware of its importance, many students think their language skills to be “good
                    enough” and turn a blind eye to these programs resulting in difficulties in the most crucial points
                    of their career.
                    So don’t wait until it’s too late. Remember, help will always be given in IITB to those who ask for
                    it ;)

                      ‘Just clear the JEE once, you’ll have fun forever’ might be a little exaggerated but if marvelling at the Eiffel Tower or basking in the breath-taking exuberance of Times Square in New York or just lying on the ground watching the Northern Lights is your idea of fun, you can surely do that here.
                      <br><br>
                      IT Bombay provides you with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study abroad at universities across the globe while you’re still a student here. The institute has partnerships with a multitude of universities as part of which you can spend up to two semesters there taking up courses which you would otherwise have to finish at IIT Bombay. Another advantage? You don’t need to pay the humungous tuition fees at the foreign university!
                      <br><br>
                      Semester exchanges are often a life changing experience, and the perfect way to immerse yourself into a completely different culture. You get to live as a local in a new country for four months and party like you’ve never done before. Besides this, the fact that you now have friends all over the world who introduce you to their own cultures is one of the major reasons students opt to go for exchanges.

                      <br>
                      <br> Congratulations on your selection! We understand that this is an important and hard decision to make, but only you can make a judgement for yourself. However, you should keep certain factors in mind while making this decision. Of course, these are all very subjective and we have only tried to give a basic guideline.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <ol>
                          <li><h5>Area of Interest</h5>

                              <br> Our first advice would be to carefully read ALL the information provided on this website and the individual
                              department websites about the curriculum and course structure of ALL branches. This should help you match your
                              interests to majors available. However, it is common for first year students to have misconceptions about branches,
                              it is true for all of us. Engineering Physics is not all about mechanics problems, Computer Science does not only
                              involve learning new programming languages and can involve heavy math, Electrical Engineering is not only about
                              transistors or circuits. If you are passionate about Aerospace engineering, then you should go with it. But try to
                              realize what is meant by passionate: designing an aircraft is a final aim which will give that satisfaction and
                               pleasure, but you will have to solve quite a few differential equations and go through basic courses to get to that.
                               Try to gather as much information as you can and speak to people in the department to verify if your understanding of the
                               department is in fact correct.
                               <br>
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li><h5>Performance of the Department</h5>

                              <br> You should also try to find out how a particular department is faring in the institute of your interest.
                              Good indicators would be the strength of faculty members, research work that goes on in the department, how the
                              courses are conducted, how are the experimental facilities, external activities/competitions that take place in the
                              department.
                              <br>
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li><h5>Future Prospects</h5>
                              <br> This is by far the factor that is unduly given the maximum amount of weightage to. However, you should
                               understand that there is always plenty of scope in every department and how you perform after 4/5 years in purely
                               contingent on you. You will find people in all departments working at variety of pay scales. Your undergraduate years
                               teach you a lot about what you like as an individual and every department has a range of things that you might end up
                               liking. And if you do, you will be able to find a way to put it good use.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li><h5>Other external factors</h5>
                              <br> These would include the amount of exposure you get in a certain institute, the kind of people you get to interact with,
                              the facilities at the institute, the flexibility that the institute provides to pursue non-academic interests etc. Again, these are
                               all very subjective.
                              <p></p>

                      <br><h4>How do I choose between a B.Tech and a Dual Degree program?</h4>
                      <br>
                      <br> The Dual Degree students are required to complete 1 extra course per semester (from a list of electives according to your specialization) from the second year and complete a Dual Degree Project (like a Master Thesis). The course coverage is the same as that of a B.Tech+M.Tech degree. It provides a more rigiorous treatment of your major but with an extra load. The B.Tech program gives a little more flexibility as you don't need to restrict yourself to courses of a particular specialization and you can gather a broader perspective, if you like. However, you can also cover more breadth in the Dual Degree Program (by taking additional courses) or go into depth in the B.tech Program (by doing Honors), it is up to you.
                      <br><br> Dual Degrees do have a restriction that they can take up minors only if they have a CPI greater than 8 as they already have to do an additional course every semester.
                      <br><br> Dual Degree programs are being recognised by universities abroad and you can directly apply for a PhD program after graduating with a Dual Degree. It also gives you an extra year to try out different things (both within your department and otherwise).
                      <br>

                      <br><br><br><br><h4>Can I change my branch after entering IIT Bombay?</h4>
                      <br>
                      <br> The option to change your branch is made available to students at the end of the first year. No such option is available in the subsequent years except the change from B.Tech to Dual Degree in the same branch. The branch change rules at IIT Bombay are below, subject to final approval of the senate.

                      <br><br>Students are eligible to apply for change of branch/programme after completing the first two semesters.

                      <br><br><h5>Minimum Eligibility Criteria</h5>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Completion of the prescribed course credits in the first two semesters</li>
                          <li>No backlog at the end of the first year</li>
                          <li>Secured a CPI of
                            , At least 8 for general and OBC category students
                            , At least 7 for SC, ST and PD category students.</li>
