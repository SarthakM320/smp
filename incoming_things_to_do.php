                                      Throughout your course here in IITB you might need various stuff from everyday items like toothpaste and soap to books for subjects. Oftentimes you would also want to detach yourself from your hectic schedule and go visit a restaurant or watch a movie. It is therefore a good idea to familiarize yourself with the various shops and places within the campus and outside it.
                                      <br><br>
                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Stationery and Xerox</p>
                                      Every Hostel has a xerox shop which is normally well equipped to handle basic stationery needs. If you don’t find something in your own hostel, you should most probably find it in the neighbouring hostel. Hostel 12 shop is the best stocked, in that regard. Most hostel xerox shops start at around 10 am and close by 9 pm. Hostel 5 shop is open till a little later (10 pm). If you are closer to the academic area, you can visit the shop in the Main Building on the ground floor, right opposite the library for notebooks, lab coats, bags, lab files, xerox, print out, and most other stationery items. During midsems and endsems, xerox shop timings for some hostels are extended.

                                      <br><br>
                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Books</p>
                                      For buying books, we have a shop called Book World on campus on the ground floor of the Gulmohar Building where you can get discounts on course-related books. Alternatively, you could go to “Popular Book Store” at YP Gate. You can also buy second-hand books from the Jay Ambe bookshop in the lane right opposite Main Gate, next to Mahavir. He also accepts books back at the end of the semester at half the price at which they were bought.

                                      <br><br>
                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Daily needs</p>
                                      For the most basic of amenities such as toothpaste, toothbrush, pens, soaps, and other such items (which one should use daily), one can go to the hostel Xerox shop itself. Another alternative would be the Hostel 12 shop which stocks almost everything one would need and more- from slippers to stationery to biscuits and towels, with servings of Computer RAM and MP3 Players on the side. One can also go to Haiko or D-Mart in the Hiranandani Complex for these. Alternatively, the shopping complex at the Y-Point Gate can also take care of most of your needs. The YP market has a post office, a dry cleaner and a tailor as well, just in case.

                                      <br><br>
                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Cellphone connections and credit</p>
                                      Sim card stalls of different operators are set up in the campus during the first week of the academic year. It is also a good idea to check out all the schemes available for different connections before settling on a cellphone service provider. Otherwise Airtel and Vodafone connections are easily available at Main Gate. Reliance has a store in Hiranandani near Subway. Vodafone has a store near the Delphi Building (next to the Cafe Coffee Day outlet). In case of prepaid connections, you need to submit a photo ID card and documents to prove that your address is what you have written in the form. If you do not do it within 2-3 days of buying the SIM, it will be disconnected. If you need passport sized photos for any forms (you should always keep some handy) you can go to the Navrang Photo Studio (Galleria) or the one right opposite Main Gate and get them clicked. For recharging your cell phone credit account you can visit your hostel shop. H3, H8 and H12 in particular have shops where you can get almost all kinds of top-ups or recharge cards. Alternatively, if you have a debit card, you could also recharge your account online.

                                      <br><br>
                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Banks and ATMs</p>
                                      Two major banks operate inside IITB: Canara Bank and SBI. The Canara bank branch is located on the first floor of the Gulmohar building. There are two Canara bank ATMs inside the campus. One is located on the ground floor of the Gulmohar building, while the other is located opposite hostel 7. There are two SBI ATMs as well. One is located between Hostel 5 and Tansa, while the other is right outside the main gate. On the orientation day, both banks set up temporary stalls in the lecture hall complex to ensure a smooth and hassle-free opening of accounts. Debit cards are provided on the spot as well.

                                      <br><br>

Head over to Naturals, Baskin Robbins, Theobroma, Cocoberry or Haagen Dazs for dessert.

However, their frequency of use often decays exponentially. But it is entirely up to you! Cycling is a quick, eco-friendly and fun way to get from point to point in the institute. Remember that maintenance of your cycle is crucial, especially in Mumbai’s rainy weather. There are two cycle repair shops on campus, one at the Market Gate and the other next to H5. A sturdy lock is also a good investment.
