                                        Hostel life at IIT Bombay is quite an integral part of your stay here. Although for some of you, it might seem a little difficult to adjust to at first, you will soon fall in love with your new home. You can find some more information in the section on Hostels.

                                        <br>
                                        As the hostels are within the campus, your entire life will be usually contained in the campus itself with the occasional outings in search of good food or for treats. Consequently, the campus is well fitted to address all of your needs, be it your daily necessities or your health. We also have a couple of guesthouses which you can avail of (probably) in case you have someone coming over to visit.
                                        <br>

                                        We hope these pages answer some of your questions and give you a basic picture of the hostel life. We look forward to having you amongst us and hope that you look forward to it too.

                                        Throughout your course here in IITB you might need various stuff from everyday items like toothpaste and soap to books for subjects. Oftentimes you would also want to detach yourself from your hectic schedule and go visit a restaurant or watch a movie. It is therefore a good idea to familiarize yourself with the various shops and places within the campus and outside it.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Stationery and Xerox</p>
                                        Every Hostel has a xerox shop which is normally well equipped to handle basic stationery needs. If you don’t find something in your own hostel, you should most probably find it in the neighbouring hostel. Hostel 8 and Hostel 12 shops are best stocked, in that regard. Most hostel xerox shops start at around 10 am and close by 9 pm. Hostel 5 shop is open till a little later (10 pm), while the Hostel 8 shop is the first to open in the morning (8 am). If you are closer to the academic area, you can visit the shop in the Main Building on the ground floor, right opposite the library for notebooks, lab coats, bags, lab files, xerox, print out, and most other stationery items. During midsems and endsems, xerox shop timings for some hostels are extended.

                                        <br><br>
                                        <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Books</p>
                                        For buying books, we have a shop called Book World on campus on the ground floor of the Gulmohar Building where you can get discounts on course-related books. Alternatively, you could go to “Popular Book Store” at YP Gate. You can also buy second-hand books from the Jay Ambe bookshop in the lane right opposite Main Gate, next to Mahavir. He also accepts books back at the end of the semester at half the price at which they were bought.

                                        <br><br>
                                        <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Daily needs</p>
                                        For the most basic of amenities such as toothpaste, toothbrush, pens, soaps, and other such items (which one should use daily), one can go to the hostel Xerox shop itself. Another alternative would be the Hostel 12 shop which stocks almost everything one would need and more- from slippers to stationery to biscuits and towels, with servings of Computer RAM and MP3 Players on the side. One can also go to Haiko or D-Mart in the Hiranandani Complex for these. Alternatively, the shopping complex at the Y-Point Gate can also take care of most of your needs. The YP market has a post office, a dry cleaner and a tailor as well, just in case.

                                        <br><br>
                                        <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Cellphone connections and credit</p>
                                        Sim card stalls of different operators are set up in the campus during the first week of the academic year. It is also a good idea to check out all the schemes available for different connections before settling on a cellphone service provider. Otherwise Airtel and Vodafone connections are easily available at Main Gate. Reliance has a store in Hiranandani near Subway. Vodafone has a store near the Delphi Building (next to the Cafe Coffee Day outlet). In case of prepaid connections, you need to submit a photo ID card and documents to prove that your address is what you have written in the form. If you do not do it within 2-3 days of buying the SIM, it will be disconnected. If you need passport sized photos for any forms (you should always keep some handy) you can go to the Navrang Photo Studio (Galleria) or the one right opposite Main Gate and get them clicked. For recharging your cell phone credit account you can visit your hostel shop. H3, H8 and H12 in particular have shops where you can get almost all kinds of top-ups or recharge cards. Alternatively, if you have a debit card, you could also recharge your account online.

                                        <br><br>
                                        <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Banks and ATMs</p>
                                        Two major banks operate inside IITB: Canara Bank and SBI. The Canara bank branch is located on the first floor of the Gulmohar building. There are two Canara bank ATMs inside the campus. One is located on the ground floor of the Gulmohar building, while the other is located opposite hostel 7. There are two SBI ATMs as well. One is located between Hostel 5 and Tansa, while the other is right outside the main gate. On the orientation day, both banks set up temporary stalls in the lecture hall complex to ensure a smooth and hassle-free opening of accounts. Debit cards are provided on the spot as well.

However, their frequency of use often decays exponentially. But it is entirely up to you! Cycling is a quick, eco-friendly and fun way to get from point to point in the institute. Remember that maintenance of your cycle is crucial, especially in Mumbai’s rainy weather. There are two cycle repair shops on campus, one at the Market Gate and the other next to H5. A sturdy lock is also a good investment.

                                        Room allotment for first year students are done in following manner :
                                        <br><br>
                                        For Boys - They will be allotted 2 wings of hostel 15 and a wing in hostel 16. On each floor, there are three subsections (also called wings!) - each wing has 6 rooms, each of which will be shared by 2 students.
                                        <br>
                                        For Girls - A separate wing of Hostel 15 (Hostel 15 C) is allotted to girls, again on a twin sharing basis.
                                        <br><br>
                                        You get the room right when you reach IIT Bombay (on the day of registrations i.e. July 26, 2019), as well as in the hostel warden’s office.
                                        <br><br>

                                        <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Basic Amenities</p>
                                        Each room has a pair of beds, tables, chairs, ceiling fans, tube lights, cupboards and are equipped with 24x7 high speed internet connectivity. There are 2 washrooms per 6 rooms with 24x7 running water (both hot and cold). Each Hostel has a mess (dining hall), a computer room, a gym, a TV, sports grounds and indoor games like Table Tennis, Carrom, Chess, the equipment for which can be availed against your ID Card. Also, stationery and xerox shops are present in Hostel 15 and 16 for fulfilling basic requirements.

                                        <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Hostel/Room Change</p>
                                        The procedure of shifting rooms basically goes through the warden of the hostel through a written application citing the reasons for the change. It will be a great experience to have a new guy as a roommate which will eventually help you in making new friends which you'll cherish for your life. Though, definitely if both of you agree, it will make things easier.

                                        <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Rules for visitors</p>
                                        Parents are not allowed to stay in the hostels without prior permission from the Hostel Coordinating Unit. Till 10 PM, female visitors to boys hostels and boys wings in Hostel 15 and male visitors to girls hostel and girls wing in Hostel 15 are allowed after entering details in a register kept with the security at the hostel entrance and after depositing the host's I-Card. After 10PM, entry is restricted only to the common areas — Mess, Lounge and Canteen.
                                        <br><br>

                                        <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Hostel Activities</p>
                                        There are a plethora of activities that go around in the hostel which makes life fun. Lot of intra hostel events and competitions (among your hostel inmates) or practice for inter hostel (with other hostels) competitions in sports and cultural activities take place all year round. Also, a variety of festivals like Lohri, Holi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Janmashtami, Dussehra, Diwali etc. are celebrated in the hostels, along with flag hoisting on Republic Day and Independence Day, keeping the atmosphere in the hostels vibrant and full of life all year round. Do participate in whatever interests you, of course after having devoted enough time to academics. It helps in breaking the ice and socializing with your batchmates and seniors.

                                        <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Hostel Council</p>
                                        The hostel council is divided into Cultural (Cult), Maintenance (Maint), Mess and Sports. Each of these councils is headed by Hostel Councillors (or Cos - generally third year students or thirdies) with Hostel Secretaries (Secys - second year students or sophies) assisting them in the administration of the hostels. All cultural programs and activities are the responsibility of the Cult Council; likewise all sports events are managed by the Sports Council. The Mess Council looks after mess and canteen while the Maint Council ensures proper working of the common areas and the hostel maintenance. All the councils are supervised by the Hostel General Secretary (GSec - a fourthie or fifthie = big daddies). To oversee hostel funds and the Student Council, every hostel has a Hall Manager and a Warden and to assist them, there are Warden Nominees. Every hostel also has an Alumni Secretary to maintain cordial relations with the hostel alumni. Computer Secretary (Comp Secy) takes care of the Computer Room and Internet connection problems while Technical Secretary (Tech Secy) manages the Technical Events at hostel and institute level. More details on the specific functions of each council member would be conveyed to you once you reach here
                                        <br><br>

                                        <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Hostel Spirit and Wing Culture</p>
                                        This is perhaps the best part of the whole deal. With time, all inmates become the part of one big family. For nothing else but the sense of belonging, you are expected to support and cheer for your hostel and other inmates in inter hostel events (this includes hooting for your hostel during the freshman orientation programmes for various clubs, of which you will come to know in due time :P). Blocks of some 10-15 rooms constitute a wing in each hostel and your wingmates (wingies) will be your immediate support group in more ways than one. We cherish the time we have spent with our wingies and we hope you do so too. Your wingies might be people from very diverse backgrounds but do not let that hinder interaction in any way. In fact, use it to your advantage. You would go with your wingies on intra hostel volley and cricket matches, treats (birthdays, crack acads, mentor's placement et al), treks, tours, hang-outs etc all the time. At the same time, socialize with other hostelers - batchmates and seniors alike - all the time. Also, ragging, simply, is a strict no no! Strict actions (expulsion from IITB) are taken against those found guilty

                                        The Internet is one of the first things you want to get sorted out once you are on campus, be it to upload your stories on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram, or to get your lecture notes and books, and get down to studying. So how and where can I access the Internet? Hostel LAN Access The most preferred option. All hostel rooms have a LAN Port which you can use to connect to the IIT Bombay network and to the Internet, provided you have a computer. Just hook your computer up to the LAN port with a cable, and you should be connected to the network. Once that’s done, there are two ways to access the Internet.

                                        The CS101 course labs will be held here. Apart from the few hours per week that you get as part of your lab timings, this lab is not accessible. It also closes after the last running lab course and is not accessible 24x7. Your lab timings would be just enough for you to finish your lab assignments. You will rarely have time to do anything apart from your CS assignment in the OSL.

                                        Depending on which department you're in, you may have access to a mediocre to excellent computer lab facility. The NSL (New Software Lab) is the department lab of the Department of CSE. It is accessible 24X7 and is WiFi enabled. The Department of Mechanical Engineering also has a Software Lab that is accessible to all its students any time of the day or night. The Department labs are very good places to study as they are air-conditioned and quiet. Depending on your department, you may or may not have a WiFi network accessible to students. Some departments either have too few computers or irregular lab timings. So this option may not work for you if you happen to be among the unlucky ones. This option also has the disadvantage of being far away from campus

                                        Faculty Advisors (FacAd), as the name suggests, are professors from your respective departments, who will help you out in making academic decisions. FacAds keep track of your progress and will guide you properly. Each semester, the courses you take will be finalized only with the consent of the FacAds. Changes in the program, such as dropping of courses, withdrawal from a semester on medical advice etc., can be affected only with the consent of the FacAd. As you grow older in the IIT system, you might have to make some tough decisions regarding coursework and programs in order to choose a career path suitable to your interests. If you intend to change your branch/specialization after the 1st year, your FacAd is the right person to approach. You may also have to seek the FacAd's permission to participate in inter-collegiate competitions. FacAd is an important link between you and your department. Do not hesitate to talk to them regarding any academic issues.

                                        Worried about what to do if you get sick while you’re in IIT-B? You don’t need to at all. The great thing about IIT-B is that it has a hospital inside the campus which will take care of almost all common medical problems you might face. To understand more about how the healthcare works at IIT, click here:

                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>How do I enroll for medical facilities?</b>
                                        <br>
                                        You are eligible for medical facilities as soon as you are admitted to IIT-B. As you get admitted, you are required to fill in your medical details in a booklet and get yourself vaccinated against certain diseases (I’ll mention about these later). The IIT-B hospital (or “hospi” as we call it here) maintains a medical file for each student to document all of their consultations, prescriptions and medical history. Every time you visit the hospital, you will need this file. In case you choose to keep it with you at your room (which is alright too) don't forget to bring it along.

                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>What to do if I fall sick or have a medical emergency?</b>
                                        <br>
                                        There is a 24/7 ambulance facility available for all students. For calling an ambulance you can call 1110 from any internal phone. One is placed at the security guard’s desk in every hostel. If you are not in an emergency, you will be required to visit a GP based on a token system or through appointments. Based on their medical evaluation you will be recommended to a specialist if need be.

                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>How expensive is the treatment?</b>
                                        <br>
                                        All of the medical facilities including prescription medicines are free for IIT students, covered by the annual insurance that you pay with the fees in the odd (Autumn) semester. This insurance also covers you for an amount of close to Rs 50,000 in medical expenses in case you need to be referred to an outside hospital. Even the cost of medicines purchased from a chemist and charges for lab tests can be reimbursed when prescribed by a doctor from the IIT hospital (or from a hospital recognised by IIT - the list of which can be found at <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/hospital/index.html" class="link">http://www.iitb.ac.in/hospital/index.html</a>)

                                        If an MRI or CT scan is required, the IIT hospital refers you to the nearby Hiranandani Hospital (HN) which is less than a kilometer away. Specialist doctors from HN hospital visit the IIT hospital on an appointment basis. For cases that the IIT hospital is not equipped cannot handle, patients are transferred to the HN hospital.

                                        <br>
                                        If you fall sick and are advised to rest by the doctor and hence cannot attend lectures or write examinations, the doctor will give you a "pink slip". This slip is the only trusted proof that you were sick and advised rest. In case you missed an end semester exam, you will be given an II grade. This means that you are eligible for a re-examination. Presenting the pink slip to your professor will let him allow you to take the exam again. This system is unremittingly strict and a recommendation from any other doctor or hospital will simply not do.

                                        <br>
                                        There are 4 vaccines which you need to be administered with during your stay here. These are :
                                        <ol class="section-ol-list">
                                            <li>MMR</li>
                                            <li>Typhoid</li>
                                            <li>Hepatitis A</li>
                                            <li>Chicken Pox</li>
                                        </ol>

                                        You can either get them administered from your local doctor in your hometown. In this case you need to show a certificate of vaccination of the same when you fill the medical booklet. If you were unable to get the vaccines, the IITB Hospital arranges a vaccination camp once every month in the Autumn ( Odd ) semester (July - November) where you can get yourself vaccinated. These vaccine costs are not covered in your medical treatment costs. Important Links:

                                        With the onset of puberty, one grows more conscious of the changes happening in their own body as well as their feelings towards others. Unlike others, some of us may not feel comfortable with the gender assigned to us at birth. Similarly, not everyone is attracted only to people of the opposite sex.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Some labels commonly used by people to describe themselves are lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, transgender, intersex, and queer. Collectively, people who lie outside the typical gender identity and sexuality are known as the LGBTQ+ community. Being a minority, they feel alone, confused and excluded from the mainstream. They may also face discrimination and bullying on revealing their preferences. At IIT Bombay, however, no student needs to feel alone.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Saathi (‘companion’) at IIT Bombay is an LGBTQ+ support and resource group. We are committed to providing a community for LGBTQ+ individuals on campus. We organize events all through the year such as workshops, awareness days, movie screenings and informal meetups. Most of these events are open to all, irrespective of gender identity or sexual orientation. Even if you identify as straight (as many of our members do), these events will be a great place to know more about the community and learn how to be great allies and support your LGBTQ+ friends.
                                        <br><br>
                                        All our events are safe spaces wherein we even do not ask anyone their sexuality or gender identity. However, we understand that you may be apprehensive of your identity being disclosed outside the group. You can still get in touch with us via e-mail or Facebook. To remain up-to-date with our events and other information, join our Google group, look up ‘Saathi, IIT Bombay’ on Google Groups or send an email at <a href="mailto:saathi-iitb+subscribe@googlegroups.com" class="link">saathi-iitb+subscribe@googlegroups.com</a>.
