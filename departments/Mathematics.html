									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<div>
The mission of the undergraduate program in Mathematics is to provide students with a broad understanding of mathematics encompassing logical reasoning, generalization, abstraction, and formal proof. Courses in the program teach students to create, analyze, and interpret mathematical models and to communicate sound arguments based on mathematical reasoning and careful data analysis.<br><br>
As undergraduates, the students are expected to demonstrate:
<ol>
<li>Problem Solving Skills</li>
<li>Ability to formulate proofs and structure mathematical arguments</li>
<li>Ability to communicate mathematical ideas through extended written presentation</li>
</ol>

									<h2>What is Mathematics Bachelor’s degree all about?</h2>
									<div>
										Mathematics is one of the oldest fields of human inquiry and integral to our culture and heritage. Its grand questions have been motivated as much by our fascination with its inherent beauty and complexity as by the practical considerations of architecture, science, and technology. In the modern world, mathematics thrives in its central role as the language of traditional science, while reaching further into the realms of engineering, finance, and social sciences.<br><br>
										The B.S. in Mathematics is designed to equip its graduates with a wide range of mathematical skills and knowledge and provide exposure to science, engineering and other subjects. They will be well-placed to make significant contributions to academia, industry and other important institutions in our society.

A study in Computer Science is not all about coding or learning multiple programming languages as it is

popularly thought. In fact, it is not even all about computers. The most crucial chunk of what you will

take away from a B. Tech in CSE, IITB is much different. The B. Tech. curriculum is designed to introduce

an undergraduate student to the entire breadth of the field of Computer Science and Engineering with a

huge diversity in the courses. While the mandatory core curriculum rarely goes into the depths of any

particular field, the department offers numerous electives that the students can take up based on the

sub-disciplines that interest them. The B. Tech. programme at IIT Bombay is one of the most flexible

among all IITs, with a very lean mandatory component - called the core curriculum, leaving you plenty of

time to explore the various fields that interest you - CSE or otherwise. True to its name, a B. Tech. study

in CSE, IITB has two major components. - Science and Engineering. But, before that you will be

acquainted with the crucial tool that will enable the study of Computer Science and all of Engineering -

Programming. This will majorly be in your first year where students of all departments will take up an

introductory course in programming. In addition, CSE first years will also have an advanced

programming course, where they will be introduced to a number of programming paradigms. “Science”

will occupy the major chunk of your courses in your second year. You will be introduced to courses in

Data Structures, Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics, Theoretical Machines, Logic, Computability, etc.

Once you’ve learnt enough science, you will learn how to apply them and create and design stuff a.k.a.

engineering. This is what you would be doing in your third year with courses like Operating Systems,

Computer Architecture, Networks, Databases. Artificial Intelligence, etc. The curriculum ensures that

there is a mix of science and engineering in all the semesters so that you don’t get bored. The final year

is left free to explore those fields that most interest you. This is in the form of electives - in the

department and otherwise and also through an optional B. Tech. Project (BTP). Below are a few

sub-disciplines of Computer Science and Engineering that you will be introduced to as part of the

curriculum with an amalgamation of both the science and engineering components to it.

<br><br>

<h3>Honors in Computer Science</h3>

A B. Tech. student is said to have “Graduated with Honours in Computer Science and Engineering” when

she/he has done a certain number of courses from the honours course list of the department over and

above the normal credit requirement (24 credits are required from the 2014 batch). These courses are

typically done in the second, third and fourth years. The exact details of the programme are clearly

specified in the academic rulebook of the Institute. The department has a fairly flexible honor

programme allowing the choice of a great number of courses for the honors requirements. Many

undergraduate courses are offered as honors courses and every postgraduate course usually is. You will

be informed in detail about the exact format of the same after your first year.

<br><br>

<h3>B. Tech. Project</h3>

Previously a mandatory component of the B. Tech curriculum, the B. Tech. project (BTP) is now optional.

The BTP is a yearlong project that allows you to have a taste of research at the undergraduate level. You

can choose any sub-field in CS that interests you the most and work on a new, unsolved research

problem under the guidance of a professor.

<br><br>

<h3>RnD Project</h3>

This is also an optional component. It is a semester long project that allows you to get an idea of

research before taking the BTP Project. This is just a mini version of BTP Project.

<br><br>

<h3>Seminars</h3>

This is generally a 3 credit course picked up by students to get an idea of the research field they might

be interested in. This allows you to explore your research interest in CS before seriously taking it up.

Contrary to the RnD that involves "development" or programming component, seminar generally

involves only literature survey.

									<h2>What kind of courses do you have to do?</h2>
									<div>
										In the first year of the programme, the courses would be common for all new entrants of IIT Bombay.The four-year programme in Mathematics aims to build a foundation in initial semesters while encouraging students to pursue more targeted interests in the second half of the programme.<br><br>

										The curriculum includes basic science courses and incorporates elective courses from science, engineering and humanities disciplines. Students have to complete basic courses in algebra, combinatorics, calculus and analysis, differential equations and probability. Advanced courses will also be on offer. Motivated students will benefit from the presence of active research groups in all of these areas. The Honours programme promotes deeper scholarship within mathematics while the Minor programme enables the pursuit of interests in other departments.<br><br>

										Students in the BS Mathematics programme (only those entering via the JEE advanced) would also be allowed branch change at the end of first year, as is the case in the Institute. Students entering through the INMO won’t be allowed to change their branch unlike the former.

									<h2>Admission Process</h2>
									<div>
										Entry to BS programme is through any one of the following two modes:
										<ol>
											<li>JEE (Advanced) as per MHRD/institute norms.</li>
											<li>Students who have appeared for their Class 12 board examinations or any equivalent qualifying examinations in 2018 and have been on the INMO (Indian National Mathematics Olympiad) Qualified List for Junior or Senior Batch in 2018 or any previous year are eligible to apply. </li>
										</ol>
										Up to 6 (six) such eligible students will be admitted to the B.S. Mathematics programme based on their performance in an entrance examination which will be conducted by the Department of Mathematics, IIT Bombay.<br><br>
										Those satisfying the eligibility criteria should apply by writing to <b><u>head.math@iitb.ac.in</u></b> with subject "Application for B.S. Mathematics Entrance Examination". They should attach with the mail a brief CV (in pdf format) and a scanned copy of INMO Award certificate and/or letter of invitation for IMO training camp. The last date to receive applications is 31st May, 2018. Eligible candidates will be informed about the details of the entrance test before 2nd June 2018. If you have any queries please write to <b><u>head.math@iitb.ac.in</u></b>
