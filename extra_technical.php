All tutorials are hand-tailored by students of IIT Bombay. However, unlike conventional programming tutorials, these take a slightly different approach. Rather than reinventing the wheel, Grundy aims at bringing together a number of online tutorials and resources along with a set of pre-requisites and motivation to learn a programming skill. We also have exhaustive lists of our community resources, projects and GSoC recommendations.

                                      Technovation is a unique Innovation Program at IIT Bombay. The term innovation derives from the Latin innovatio, "to renew or change" from (in- "into" + novus"new"). The program aims at providing you the platform to work on fascinating engineering projects, fully funded and mentored by senior students. It’s a unique opportunity for every innovative person out there to leave his mark on the technical scene. Have you ever wondered whether your school could have its own Marauder’s Map or have you felt the need for your very own Remembrall? Well we think it is indeed possible and we are working to make that possible. Technovation offers a wide range of challenging and innovation driven projects.Some of the past successful projects are Book Keeping Robot, Parinat (Humanoid).

                                      IIT Bombay can now boast of the rare privilege of being one of the very few universities world wide to have successfully launched its own satellite. Christened Pratham, being IIT Bombay's first foray into space technology, the satellite's payload was to produce data on the total electron count in the atmosphere, used for applications like GPS correction. Planned, designed, built and tested exclusively by the students, with guidance from Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and IITB faculty, the completely autonomous satellite Pratham took IIT Bombay into the elite space club on 26th September 2016, when it was launched by ISRO on board the PSLV C-35. The team has now begun the next chapter in the Student Satellite Project of IITB and work has begun on Advitiy, the second satellite. The team has also built an autonomous groundstation at IIT Bombay for tracking and communicating with satellites. With groundstation workshops, HAM Club and various other related activities, the Project also aims to involve other universities across India and spread the knowledge accumulated by the team over the years as a part of the social goal. The current teams looks forward to having curious, industrious and enthusiastic freshmen from the new batch join in the efforts on both Advitiy and the other satellites to be developed at the institute and also help achieve the social goal of the Project.

Our primary goal is to build a robust, all terrain and remotely operated rover for Martian exploration. We are a relatively young tech team, and have been working on rover prototypes for participation into URC (University Rover Challenge), an annual competition held in Utah, USA, since 2014. We are currently building a rover prototype (pic shown below) to perform all the necessary tasks on a Mars mission such as terrain traversing, astronaut assistance, autonomous navigation and soil sampling & analysis. Apart from this, our rover can have many earthly applications such as in agriculture and defence for unmanned surveillance.

                                      Apart from Technical Orientation at the start of the year, most clubs and teams will have their individual orientations and beginner level events. Keep an eye out for posters on the Hostel Notice Boards. In addition all the clubs have dedicated web-pages, facebook pages and online discussion boards where activities are discussed in great detail. It would be a great idea to sign up for these. In addition feel free to contact the individual club conveners to help you out with your queries.
                                      <br><br>
                                      Most hostels also have Tech Rooms which are accessible through contact with Technical Secretary. Finally, some of the Institute labs may be made accessible for personal use after contacting the person in-charge.
                                      <br><br>
                                      Another great idea to stay in touch with Tech is to engage yourself in one of the various projects running through the Institute. Apart from these one can also float personal projects which can be coordinated with either UMIC or one of the hobby clubs depending upon the exact idea in question.
                                      <br><br>
                                      <b>Note</b>: Most of the newsgroups are Google groups and it would be a nice idea to sign up for a Google account if you don't have one yet. Here we have barely scratched the surface of the scope of Tech at IITB. More detailed information is readily available on the club web pages and newsgroups.
