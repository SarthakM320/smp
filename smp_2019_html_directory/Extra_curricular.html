                <p>So you thought it was all about academics? Wrong! IITB is privileged to have one of the best cultural (or 'cult') scenes among engineering colleges in India. Apart from hosting Mood Indigo, India's biggest college cultural festival, we have a very active intra-college scene, with genre specific clubs and plenty of hostel and insti-level events all year round. The scene is basically split into 10 genres: Music, Photography & Fine Arts, Speaking/Debating, Literary Arts, Photography & Fine Arts, Dance, Dramatics,  Film & Media, Design and Lifestyle. </p>

              <br>
                <p><b>The Scene</b>
                  <br>
                 At the Institute level, the scene is governed by the Institute Cultural Council, headed by the General Secretary of Cultural Affairs. Working with him are 8 Institute Secretaries, for the aforementioned 10 genres. Each secretary is the head of the club(s) under his/her domain. Also, at the hostel level, each hostel has a Cultural Councilor along with a secretary for each of the genres. The incoming freshers are pre allocated to the hostels they are going into the next year and they represent their senior hostels throughout the year.
                </p>

                <p><b>Freshizza</b>
                  <br>
                  The most important cultural event of your first semester here is Freshiezza, the inter-hostel freshmen cultural competition. Usually held in 2 phases over the first semester, Freshiezza is where you battle it out for hostel glory in a host of events from all areas of the cult sphere and explore what insti ‘cult’ has to offer for you. Do participate, if you can, or else at least come and cheer your hostel on. Stay back that weekend, we guarantee you won't regret it.
                </p>

                <p><b>Intra College events </b>
                    <br> Inter-hostel General Championship (GC) events that are held throughout the year decide your hostel's
                    position in the Cultural GC, winning which is very prestigious. Recently, even freshies have been allowed
                    to represent their senior year hostels in GCs. In addition, the cultural council organizes a huge number of
                     open events spread across the year. These events have no restrictions; some, on the contrary, have freshmen
                     reservations. </p>

                <p>Now, coming to the Cultural clubs. </p>

                <p><b>Literary Arts: Literati</b>
                    <br> Quizzes, Creative writing, Rebuses, Blogs and Word Games all fall under the reign of Literati.

                    <br> When creativity meets passion, design happens. Design is thoughts given shape; to put together the pieces of a puzzle, not knowing of what would unfold. Have an idea? Give it shape and bring it into existence; scribble it out or express yourself digitally. The Design team came into existence in 2014, with the motive of creating a culture of design in the institute, bringing together aspects from all genres of art. The amazing response we got has encouraged us to go further and expand across the genres, to have infrastructure set aside for enthusiastic people. Designers showcase their talent in  Vision, the institute's annual design festival. GC Event: Design GC </p>

                <p><b>Inter college events </b>
                    <br>
                    Every December, IITB hosts India's biggest cult fest, Mood Indigo. MI is a 4 day long cultural extravaganza that sees participation by thousands of students from all over the country. Apart from formal and informal competitions and workshops, it also organizes concerts and performances by international artistes. IITB students attend numerous college cult fests but we only send official contingents to two, St. Xavier's Malhar (around 15th Aug) in Mumbai and IIM-B's Unmaad (around 29th Jan). Freshies generally attend Unmaad in large numbers.
                  </p>

                <p><b>Performing Arts Festival (PAF)</b>
                    <br> PAF is also known as the 'Baap of all cultural events’. Typically, three or
                     four hostels (out of fourteen) are grouped together to battle against one another.
                     From script to dance, music to dram, every damn thing is handled by the students. PAF is
                      renowned for its 'Prod work' which involves the making of sets and backdrops. A tremendous
                      mixture of art and cultural skills combined with life sized sets, is what makes PAF an event to remember.
                    <br> By that time, you will be allotted your 'permanent' hostels and hence will be a good time to
                    make new friends and get acquainted with the hostel culture.
                    <br> At the end of the academic year, the institute hands out awards to those who
                    have excelled in cultural activities, along with the inter-hostel GC and PAF trophies.
                    <br> So there you have it. Cult at IITB is truly in a league of its own, so please do
                    grab every opportunity to be a part of it. And remember, never be hesitant to join a club or
                     attend a meeting just because you feel you're not good enough - most of us knew nothing about
                      our current cult interests/passions when we first started out, back in our first years. The
                      institute clubs welcome students of all levels, from noobs to pros.
                    <br> A mandatory word of caution though: do not sacrifice your academics for the sake of extra-
                    curricular activities; prioritize your interests and allocate your time wisely. That being said, we do hope you enjoy
                    every bit of your 4/5 years here, and hopefully the cultural scene would be a major part of your college lives. </p>

                    <h4>Introduction</h4>

                    <p>Excellence in sports is a direct index of the stature and intellectual maturity of an institute. IIT

                    Bombay has always aimed to set a precedent for other institutions by laying utmost

                    emphasis on the multifaceted development of its students and pushing them to raise the bar

                    by striving to be ‘Citius, Altius, Fortius’. With a deeply ingrained sports culture and the ‘Right

                    of Sports for all’ as a cornerstone of its Sports policy, the institute has, over the years,

                    channelized its resources towards the development of a state of the art sporting complex

                    that caters to over fourteen sports. All the facilities are helmed by seasoned training staff so

                    that even beginners have a beautiful chance to learn the craft and their more experienced

                    counterparts can receive the requisite guidance.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4> Facilities</h4>

                    <p>IITB offers its students sports facilities of an international level with fully-furnished courts and

                    high-quality equipment.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h4> Sports for everyone</h4>

                    <p>A passion for sports has always been a part of the very fabric of the institute. To ensure a

                    healthy continuity of this tradition the Sports Council organises a multitude of sports and

                    fitness camps that vary in the degree of professionalism (amateur, intermediate or

                    advanced) as well as the rigour of instruction. Moreover, to keep with dynamically evolving

                    exercise regimens, workshops on modern forms like Zumba, Mixed Martial Arts and

                    AquaYoga and target specific weight loss camps are conducted. And to satisfy the cravings

                    of the adventure streak in all of us, there are regular excursions to the Himalayas, daunting

                    treks and adrenaline pumping sports like rafting, rock climbing and mountaineering, with

                    scuba diving plans in the pipeline.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Government of India, through the National Sports Organisation, mandates that all

                    incoming freshmen must undergo a structured training in a sport of their choice. At IIT

                    Bombay, NSO forms an integral part of the curriculum and classes are offered in sports with

                    biweekly instruction.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4> Aavhan</h4>

                    <p>The inaugural edition of Aavhan, IIT Bombay’s sports festival, which was held from 24 th May

                    2017 to 26 th May 2017, was a three day extravaganza that brought together participants to

                    combine the thrill of competition with the joy of sports. The state-of- the-art facilities at the

                    institute played host to over three thousand sportspersons representing universities, clubs

                    and organizations across the nation. Tough battles were waged across courts, fields and the

                    pool in a bid to bring home the glittering trophies that were at stake in thirteen different

                    sports.
                    <br><br>

                    The fever that had engulfed the campus was tangible as all events witnessed large spectator

                    turnout. Despite there being some of the finest talent from across the country for display, the

                    IIT Bombay contingent refused to give any quarter and ensured that all their opponents had

                    to toil and prove their mettle to emerge champions.
                    <br><br>

                    The extensive planning and relentless work that was put in by the Sports Council, the

                    support staff and other authorities to get the sponsors on board and translate this long

                    standing dream into a reality was evident from the flawless execution of the event. The

                    grand success of the festival can be attributed to the way it managed to capture the passion

                    to conquer and the quest for glory- the very essence of all sporting activity. Now that Aavhan

                    is set to be an annual fixture, it only promises to get bigger, better and more entertaining and

                    we couldn’t be more excited!</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4> The Council</h4>

                    <p>The responsibility for the efficient management of all issues pertaining to sports at the

                    institute level rests with the Sports Council, an annually elected body. Helmed by the

                    General Secretary, the council comprises 4 nominees, 14 sport-specific secretaries, 1

                    Technical Head, 1 Creatives Head and a Conveners.</p>

                    <h4> Championships</h4>

                    <p>At the institute level itself, a steady string of competitive events is organised throughout the

                    year with tournaments on conventional sports, upcoming games as well as their modern

                    improvisations. The General Championships are keenly contested as they bring budding

                    talent into the spotlight besides resting on a traditional yet healthy inter-hostel rivalry as its

                    bedrock. The ever increasing participation among girls has prompted the advent of a

                    separate Girls GC which is now a permanent fixture. Outside of the mainstream GC

                    framework, leagues and events are also organised periodically to allow players to hone and

                    display their skills and to instil a sporting ethic among all students. For fostering a spirit of

                    fraternity in the hostels, the Hostel Council holds multiple events to promote interaction

                    across batches and departments.</p>

                    <h4> Inter IIT Championships</h4>

                    <p>Touted as the ‘Holy Grail’ amongst all the sports events, representing IITB at the Inter IIT

                    Sports meet is the ultimate honour for any student at the institute. Each year, one of the

                    seven older IITs plays host to contingents from the other campuses, with players in their

                    quest for glory competing fiercely to lift the coveted trophy.
                    <br><br>

                    Moreover, considering the level at which the competition operates and the fact that it is the

                    highest stature that can be associated with a sportsperson at the institute, getting to

                    represent IITB at this event in the first year itself ought to be a matter of great honour and

                    pride for any freshman.
                    <br><br>

                    In recent years, IITB won the Overall General Championships for 3 consecutive years 2007-

                    2009, and then again in 2012. The 50 th Inter IIT Sport Meet was hosted rather magnificently

                    by the institute. That there have been several instances of individuals being crowned

                    champions at the meet in sports they learnt only after joining the institute speaks volumes of

                    how IIT Bombay provides ample opportunities to cultivate talent and nurture it.
                    <br><br>

                    The championship is held in December every year, with a separate aquatics meet in

                    October. For the main meet, selection trials commence in October. Those selected become

                    a part of the Inter IIT Training Camp which begins from 1 st December, continuing until the

                    date of departure.</p>

                      IIT Bombay can now boast of the rare privilege of being one of the very few universities world wide to have successfully launched its own satellite. Christened Pratham, being IIT Bombay's first foray into space technology, the satellite's payload was to produce data on the total electron count in the atmosphere, used for applications like GPS correction. Planned, designed, built and tested exclusively by the students, with guidance from Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and IITB faculty, the completely autonomous satellite Pratham took IIT Bombay into the elite space club on 26th September 2016, when it was launched by ISRO on board the PSLV C-35. The team has now begun the next chapter in the Student Satellite Project of IITB and work has begun on Advitiy, the second satellite. The team has also built an autonomous groundstation at IIT Bombay for tracking and communicating with satellites. With groundstation workshops, HAM Club and various other related activities, the Project also aims to involve other universities across India and spread the knowledge accumulated by the team over the years as a part of the social goal. The current teams looks forward to having curious, industrious and enthusiastic freshmen from the new batch join in the efforts on both Advitiy and the other satellites to be developed at the institute and also help achieve the social goal of the Project.

                    <h4>IIT-B Mars Rover Team</h4>
                    <p>
                      The IITB Mars Rover Team, a part of the Mars Society India (MSI), is a team of space enthusiasts looking to build space grade technologies for future manned missions to Mars. Our primary goal is to build a robust, all terrain and remotely operated rover for Martian exploration. We are a relatively young tech team, and have been working on rover prototypes for participation into URC (University Rover Challenge), an annual competition held in Utah, USA, since 2014.
                      We are currently building a rover prototype (pic shown below) to perform all the necessary tasks on a Mars mission such as terrain traversing, astronaut assistance, autonomous navigation and soil sampling & analysis. Apart from this, our rover can have many earthly applications such as in agriculture and defence for unmanned surveillance.
                      <br><br>
                      Have a look at <a href="https://iitbmartian.github.io">https://iitbmartian.github.io</a> for further information and latest updates about the team.

                    <h4>Inter College Festivals</h4>
                    <p>
                      There are a lot of local college festivals which are very accessible to freshman teams from the Institute. More details on these will be available through their specific website and through the STAB website. IIT Bombay also has a strong tradition of winning participation at Techfest. Some problem statements at Techfest are again very accessible to freshman. More details about these are available on the Techfest website and through various sessions held at both the hostel and institute level.

                    <h4>Where to Begin</h4>
                    <p>Apart from Technical Orientation at the start of the year, most clubs and teams will have their individual orientations and beginner level events. Keep an eye out for posters on the Hostel Notice Boards. In addition all the clubs have dedicated web-pages, facebook pages and online discussion boards where activities are discussed in great detail. It would be a great idea to sign up for these. In addition feel free to contact the individual club conveners to help you out    with your queries.
                      <br><br>
                      Most hostels also have Tech Rooms which are accessible through contact with Technical Secretary. Finally, some of the Institute labs may be made accessible for personal use after contacting the person in-charge.
                      <br><br>Another great idea to stay in touch with Tech is to engage yourself in one of the various projects running through the Institute. Apart from these one can also float personal projects which can be coordinated with either UMIC or one of the hobby clubs depending upon the exact idea in question.
                      <br><br><b>Note:</b> Most of the newsgroups are Google groups and it would be a nice idea to sign up for a Google account if you don't have one yet. Here we have barely scratched the surface of the scope of Tech at IITB. More detailed information is readily available on the club web pages and newsgroups.

NSS IIT Bombay gives you an opportunity of contributing to Community service while the time you invest also contributes towards fulfilling your academic requirements.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>What is NSS?</h4>
                  <p>
                    As part of NOCS01 and NOCS02 (Compulsory courses for passing out of IIT Bombay), you can opt for NSS, NSO or NCC. Thus NSS (National Service Scheme) becomes part of your curriculum during your first year where you invest your time for the betterment of society around you. NSS IIT Bombay is the largest volunteer group inside campus working in the field of Community service and has been working in various fields. Education of underprivileged kids, improving their lifestyle, maintaining the biodiversity, using engineering knowledge to improve the innovations by uneducated, sustainable development are a few of the areas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NSS organises sessions on daily basis. First year students have the responsibilities like teaching school subjects and other extra curricular activities to the children, planting tree saplings for specific purposes and maintaining them, innovating different activities like how can we reuse the trash, making something useful from trash, surveying and suggesting improvements in innovations by grassroot innovators, meeting underprivileged people like construction workers, understanding their problems and working towards solving them, creating content for NSS YouTube channels (Open Learning Initiative -an initiative to make educational content available in regional language and Voice for Purpose - an initiative for making audiobooks available for visually challenged). These are just a few activities among the many activities you can participate.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    First year students, when selected in NSS, are allotted a department inside NSS according to their preferences and the team guides them regarding all the activities. If you have never experienced the joy of giving and want to explore the ecstasy of doing something selflessly, this is the right place to invest your time in!
