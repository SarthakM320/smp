                                      Room allotment for first year students are done in following manner :
                                      <br><br>
                                      For Boys - They will be allotted 2 wings of hostel 15 and a wing in hostel 16. On each floor, there are three subsections (also called wings!) - each wing has 6 rooms, each of which will be shared by 2 students.
                                      <br>
                                      For Girls - A separate wing of Hostel 15 (Hostel 15 C) is allotted to girls, again on a twin sharing basis.
                                      <br><br>
                                      You get the room right when you reach IIT Bombay (on the day of registrations i.e. July 26, 2019), as well as in the hostel warden’s office.
                                      <br><br>

                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Basic Amenities</p>
                                      Each room has a pair of beds, tables, chairs, ceiling fans, tube lights, cupboards and are equipped with 24x7 high speed internet connectivity. There are 2 washrooms per 6 rooms with 24x7 running water (both hot and cold). Each Hostel has a mess (dining hall), a computer room, a gym, a TV, sports grounds and indoor games like Table Tennis, Carrom, Chess, the equipment for which can be availed against your ID Card. Also, stationery and xerox shops are present in Hostel 15 and 16 for fulfilling basic requirements.
                                      <br><br>

                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Hostel/Room Change</p>
                                      The procedure of shifting rooms basically goes through the warden of the hostel through a written application citing the reasons for the change. It will be a great experience to have a new guy as a roommate which will eventually help you in making new friends which you'll cherish for your life. Though, definitely if both of you agree, it will make things easier.
                                      <br><br>

                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Rules for visitors</p>
                                      Parents are not allowed to stay in the hostels without prior permission from the Hostel Coordinating Unit. Till 10 PM, female visitors to boys hostels and boys wings in Hostel 15 and male visitors to girls hostel and girls wing in Hostel 15 are allowed after entering details in a register kept with the security at the hostel entrance and after depositing the host's I-Card. After 10PM, entry is restricted only to the common areas — Mess, Lounge and Canteen.
                                      <br><br>

                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Hostel Activities</p>
                                      There are a plethora of activities that go around in the hostel which makes life fun. Lot of intra hostel events and competitions (among your hostel inmates) or practice for inter hostel (with other hostels) competitions in sports and cultural activities take place all year round. Also, a variety of festivals like Lohri, Holi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Janmashtami, Dussehra, Diwali etc. are celebrated in the hostels, along with flag hoisting on Republic Day and Independence Day, keeping the atmosphere in the hostels vibrant and full of life all year round. Do participate in whatever interests you, of course after having devoted enough time to academics. It helps in breaking the ice and socializing with your batchmates and seniors.
                                      <br><br>

                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Hostel Council</p>
                                      The hostel council is divided into Cultural (Cult), Maintenance (Maint), Mess and Sports. Each of these councils is headed by Hostel Councillors (or Cos - generally third year students or thirdies) with Hostel Secretaries (Secys - second year students or sophies) assisting them in the administration of the hostels. All cultural programs and activities are the responsibility of the Cult Council; likewise all sports events are managed by the Sports Council. The Mess Council looks after mess and canteen while the Maint Council ensures proper working of the common areas and the hostel maintenance. All the councils are supervised by the Hostel General Secretary (GSec - a fourthie or fifthie = big daddies). To oversee hostel funds and the Student Council, every hostel has a Hall Manager and a Warden and to assist them, there are Warden Nominees. Every hostel also has an Alumni Secretary to maintain cordial relations with the hostel alumni. Computer Secretary (Comp Secy) takes care of the Computer Room and Internet connection problems while Technical Secretary (Tech Secy) manages the Technical Events at hostel and institute level. More details on the specific functions of each council member would be conveyed to you once you reach here
                                      <br><br>

                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">Hostel Spirit and Wing Culture</p>
                                      This is perhaps the best part of the whole deal. With time, all inmates become the part of one big family. For nothing else but the sense of belonging, you are expected to support and cheer for your hostel and other inmates in inter hostel events (this includes hooting for your hostel during the freshman orientation programmes for various clubs, of which you will come to know in due time :P). Blocks of some 10-15 rooms constitute a wing in each hostel and your wingmates (wingies) will be your immediate support group in more ways than one. We cherish the time we have spent with our wingies and we hope you do so too. Your wingies might be people from very diverse backgrounds but do not let that hinder interaction in any way. In fact, use it to your advantage. You would go with your wingies on intra hostel volley and cricket matches, treats (birthdays, crack acads, mentor's placement et al), treks, tours, hang-outs etc all the time. At the same time, socialize with other hostelers - batchmates and seniors alike - all the time. Also, ragging, simply, is a strict no no! Strict actions (expulsion from IITB) are taken against those found guilty

                                      We at IIT Bombay like to do things differently and we even have small language “Mods” called the IITB Lingo. Here is a list (albeit not an exhaustive one) of the slanguage used at IITB, that would help you to get started and not feel alienated in the campus. With time though, this language would seem very natural

                                      <br><br>

                                      The Internet is one of the first things you want to get sorted out once you are on campus, be it to upload your stories on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram, or to get your lecture notes and books, and get down to studying. So how and where can I access the Internet? Hostel LAN Access The most preferred option. All hostel rooms have a LAN Port which you can use to connect to the IIT Bombay network and to the Internet, provided you have a computer. Just hook your computer up to the LAN port with a cable, and you should be connected to the network. Once that’s done, there are two ways to access the Internet.

                                      <p class="section-sub-heading mb-1">OSL (Old Software Lab)</p>
                                      The CS101 course labs will be held here. Apart from the few hours per week that you get as part of your lab timings, this lab is not accessible. It also closes after the last running lab course and is not accessible 24x7. Your lab timings would be just enough for you to finish your lab assignments. You will rarely have time to do anything apart from your CS assignment in the OSL.

                                      Depending on which department you're in, you may have access to a mediocre to excellent computer lab facility. The NSL (New Software Lab) is the department lab of the Department of CSE. It is accessible 24X7 and is WiFi enabled. The Department of Mechanical Engineering also has a Software Lab that is accessible to all its students any time of the day or night. The Department labs are very good places to study as they are air-conditioned and quiet. Depending on your department, you may or may not have a WiFi network accessible to students. Some departments either have too few computers or irregular lab timings. So this option may not work for you if you happen to be among the unlucky ones. This option also has the disadvantage of being far away from campus

                                      The Library, and the classrooms in the Lecture Hall Complex(LHs, LCs and LTs) are wifi enabled. Just turn on your WiFi and connect to IITB-Wireless or eduroam with your LDAP ID and password. Your device may also have an anonymous identity field while connecting, which can be left blank. The IITB-Guest WiFi is meant for short term visitors, and will also require LDAP authentication through a separate portal.
